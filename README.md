# Resume-analysis
This is the implementation for resume analysis. The code is divided into three part. Use resume labelling code to label and make training and testing dataset. For resume analysis, rule-based and deep-learning based method are both provided. Deep-learning based method is using Bi-lstm to learn the semantics information.

## Environment:

- Keras, Tensorflow
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
- Nltk
- Scipy,  h5py,  pillow, pdfminer.six
- CUDA Version: 11.0 
- Python 3.8
